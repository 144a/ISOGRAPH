# ISOGRAPH

Just a simple z=f(y,x) equation graphing Utility I made while on a Summer road trip. It uses matrix multiplication to quickly calculate the corresponding 3D points and projects them onto the 2D calculator screen. It also allows you to rotate the graph by a couple of degrees in any of the basic four cardinal directions by using the arrow keys after it has finished graphing (at the expense of around 40 seconds to recalculate the points). I don't quite know what it will be useful for, but it might come in handy for some advanced statistics or multi-variable calculus.

The text files allow for easy observation of the code with out the ti connect editor.
